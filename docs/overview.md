## Tufts Code for Good
Tufts Code for Good is a program run by Tufts alumni to help students gain meaningful work experience during summer 2020.

Project mentors help students scope projects, the overall timeline, set weekly goals, check in on the status of the project, find resources when they get stuck, and keep the team in sync.

### Project Mentor Responsibilities

- Meet virtually with your team twice per week
- Help the project leader set goals for each team member at the beginning of the week
- Check in on the status of the project at the end of each week
- Direct students to appropriate resources (esp. dedicated Slack channels) when they get stuck
- Participate in some client meetings, help students communicate effectively with the project client
- Mid-summer check-in with Code for Good coordinators
