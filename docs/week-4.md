Self-guided feature development

## Objectives
- Learn how to estimate and plan self-guided work
- Develop features to let users create, update, delete fundraisers

## Getting Started

Now that you have a full stack web app deployed to Heroku, you'll be taking the
lead with driving feature development. Before you start, think about what core
features are important to have for an MVP.

## Deliverables
Once you’ve gone through the items under ‘Getting Started’ you should be ready!

Deliverables TBD, will be up to you!
