## Github Repos
Based on our initial conversation, we’ll be using technologies with which you’re most familiar. For this project, we’ll have two repositories: one for a NodeJS + MongoDB backend, and one for a ReactJS front end.

1. [NodeJS + MongoDB server with JWT Auth](https://github.com/jroth01/donation-tracker-server) 

2. [ReactJS Front End](https://github.com/jroth01/donation-tracker-client)

## Kanban Board

[Donation Tracker Project Kanban](https://github.com/users/jroth01/projects/1)

I’ll do my best to break down tasks into smaller milestones each week. For a higher level view, here’s where we’ll handle project management tasks in a Kanban style board. The cards on the board will reference github issues. As you complete pull requests that reference the issues, items in the board will automatically shift over.
