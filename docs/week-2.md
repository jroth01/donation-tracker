## Objectives
- Finish up outstanding items from last week
- Get familiar with ReactJS, Client-side UI development
- Integrate your API endpoints with a front end

## Getting Started
1. Clone the ReactJS Front end repo
2. Launch the NodeJS + MongoDB server you’ve been working on locally 
3. Start the ReactJS front end using the steps outlined in the ReadMe
4. Explore the front end in the browser, and take a look at the code


## Deliverables
Once you’ve gone through the items under ‘Getting Started’ you should be ready!

Here are the deliverables for this week. This week you’ll be finishing up the previous [Fundraiser API resource](https://github.com/jroth01/donation-tracker-server/milestone/1), and thinking about front end user experience (UX) for this week’s [milestone](https://github.com/jroth01/donation-tracker-client/milestone/1).

1. Address [PR feedback](https://github.com/jroth01/donation-tracker-server/pull/6) for Fundraiser API resource. Make sure do a ‘git pull origin master’ to grab some updates (prettier, pre-commit hooks) from the main branch.
2. Populate your [local mongodb instance with some test fundraisers](https://github.com/users/jroth01/projects/1#card-40220867)
3. [Read up on React, React-Router, React-Bootstrap](https://github.com/jroth01/donation-tracker-client/issues/2). See resources below. 
4. [Create fundraiser detail page accessible by /fundraisers/:id](https://github.com/jroth01/donation-tracker-client/issues/3)
5. [Stretch Goal: Create fundraiser list page](https://github.com/jroth01/donation-tracker-client/issues/2)

Don’t worry if you have difficulty or don’t finish! This may or may not be ambitious depending on your comfort level. If you need help, there are plenty of resources available.
