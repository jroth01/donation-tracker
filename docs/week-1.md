Back end development with NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose. JWT authentication

## Objectives
- Think broadly about the direction of the project
- Set up your development environment
- Get familiar with Github, Git, NodeJS, MongoDB, mongoose, the basics of JWT authentication
- Read and understand some existing code
- Write some code + author some pull requests on Github!

## Getting Started
1. Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. Download Robo3T
   - Go to https://robomongo.org/download
   - Click ‘Download Robo3T’
4. Download [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)
5. Download [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
   - I will separately send you a Postman Collection + Environment. This will help you test the API code running locally (and also remotely once we deploy it).
6. Clone the [donation-tracker-server](https://github.com/jroth01/donation-tracker-server) repo onto your local machine
7. Follow the steps in the README to launch the server. If possible, we’ll do this together during today’s meeting. You must have mongodb running for the server to work properly.

## Deliverables
Once you’ve gone through the items under ‘Getting Started’ you should be ready to write some code! I’ve outlined some items for you to complete in this milestone. A milestone represents a phase of work, usually broken down into sub-items. 

This week you’ll be implementing some API endpoints, and also answering some design questions:

Here are the items for this week’s [milestone](https://github.com/jroth01/donation-tracker-server/milestone/1), reproduced here:
1. [Answer some design questions](https://github.com/jroth01/donation-tracker-server/issues/5) - you can answer these by replying to the issue with a comment
2. [Create POST api/fundraisers endpoint](https://github.com/jroth01/donation-tracker-server/issues/1)
3. [Create GET api/fundraisers/{id} endpoint](https://github.com/jroth01/donation-tracker-server/issues/2)
4. [Create GET api/fundraisers endpoint](https://github.com/jroth01/donation-tracker-server/issues/4)
5. [Create DELETE api/fundraisers/{id} endpoint](https://github.com/jroth01/donation-tracker-server/issues/3)

Don’t worry if you have difficulty or don’t finish! This may or may not be ambitious depending on your comfort level. If you need help, there are plenty of resources available.
