### What went well last week?
- After having a screensharing session last week to review code, was easy to make changes to the backend
- React resources were good

### What didnâ€™t go well?
- Struggled to find examples of structure for larger react components
- Took longer than expected to get comfortable with React and connect it to the backend. (Understanding hooks vs class components)

### What did you learn?
- How to write more modular code
- How the API endpoints tie together
- React state, virtual DOM

### What still puzzles you?
- Had some git issues
- How should I structure my project (React components)?

### What should we do differently next week?
- Be conscious of time, make regular commits throughout the week
- Trying to make a little progress each day
- Message in slack for mid-week check in
