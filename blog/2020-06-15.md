## What's a retro?
A retrospective (or retro for short) is an opportunity for a team to reflect, adapt, and improve. Many teams to have a retro after each “sprint”, or time-boxed iteration of work. Since we just finished the first week, here are some questions to consider.

### What went well last week?
- good level of difficulty, amount of work
- having a laid out spec was very helpful
- majority of the time spent figuring out the code
- setup went great on first day(1 issue getting mongo going locally)
- learning javascript syntax
got a lot better at troubleshooting by the end of the week!

### What didn’t go well?
- sometimes knowing what to google took a while
getting stuck, taking hours to write a few lines of code
- ability to commit time this week, balancing personal commitments 

### What did you learn?
- learning how to troubleshoot open ended problems
specifics of javascript syntax, request response, noSQL, mongo

### What still puzzles you?
- want to go back over jwt verification methods, ensure i’m not doing redundant checks 

### What should we do differently next week?
- keep it similar to last week in terms of having a weekly spec
- preview the tasks ahead of time and research concepts to have better background knowledge
